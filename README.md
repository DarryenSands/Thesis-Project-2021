# Thesis-Project-2021
All of the files related to my thesis project: including machine learning files, pycbc files, and others.
My thesis involves studying gravitational waves through the use of machine learning. I plan on training a machine learning algorithm and comparing it to matched filtering analysis. Hopefully this algorithm will be able to identify confirmed gravitational waves first and foremost. Ideally, it will be able to do much more but I think this is a good starting point.
